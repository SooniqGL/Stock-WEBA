<font class="instruction_text">
<ul>
<li>The keywords in the search can be empty.  In that case, upto 1000 existing groups will be returned in the search.  To make more accurate search, 
you may use keywords to narrow down the results.</li>
<li>We use "startWith" search on the group names, and it is case insenstive.  So, you may need to know the first few letters in the
group's name that you like to search.</li>
<li>If you know the Group ID for the group, can enter the Group ID as well.  The search will try to bring exact group using the ID</li>
<li>Click the link of the group name to see if you have joined or not in the group.  If you are not joined, a "Request To Join" button
will be provided for you to request to join the group.  However, if the group is not accepting anymore, this button will not be available.
