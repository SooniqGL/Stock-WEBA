			Market belongs to the people who have the good technologies and who can follow certain
			sounding rules.  We present the stock market models in searching
			the best potential stocks to long or short. We develop 				
			both simple ideas and complex theories.  Our models have been well tested against
			the market for a long time.  Our performances are very reliable in probability sense.
			Our users love to use our services.

			<FONT color="#006699">Our Systems</FONT>
		
				We keep the current market data and use our rules to screen the stocks.  The best
				ones in our senses will be returned to the users.  We only use charts and volume information
				to do our screening.
				<br>
				There are four models we will present to our members.<br><br>
				<ol><li>Linear Model<br>
				This is using the straight line to approach the chart.  Find the best fit.  We believe the
				trend will continue if there is not any dangerous signal.  To make it more profitable, we 
				also detect the danger and return only the good ones we think.
				</li>
				<li>Break Up/Down<br>
				This is a typical pattern lookup.  We pay more attention to more reliable break ups or downs.
				Currently, we only do flat base and cup-handler breaks.  Many detailed check ups are done to the
				stocks before they are selected.  We believe a good break up or down is the beginning 
				of a long and powerful trend.
				</li>
				<li>Momentum Search<br>
				We use our indicators we have developed to find the stocks strong and ready to go.  This
				is similar to MACD technology but better in many situations.  Our indicators are sensitive
				to the crtical turns, and relatively stable if the trend is going well.
				</li>
				<%--
				<li>A+ Search<br>
				This is for a relatively long term holding.  We analyze the support/resistence,
				distribution/accumulation, trend up/down, over sold/bought, over extended, etc.  
				Our goal is to define the potentials.  Then find the highest potentials.
				<br>
				<font color="#0000ff">Will release soon.</font>
				</li>
				<li>Pattern Analysis<br>
				This is the most complex system we have developed.  We classify the stock charts to finite different kinds.
				Then in any time we calculate the behavior of each pattern.  We find the pattern 
				switching matrix (in probability sense).  Combine these together, we pick out
				the best candidates in probabilty sense.  This model fits well for the swing traders.
				<br>
				<font color="#0000ff">Will release soon.</font>
				</li>--%>
				</ol>
				<br>
				Most importantly, we use our indicators to previde analysis for any given individual stock. 
				 This will give users some crtical guidelines about the stocks they want to know.

								<TD align="left" height="40">
									<ol><li>General Market<br>

									<ul>
									<li>Watch market life cycles: accumulation, up, top-distribution and down.</li>
									<li>Bull market extends four or five years while bear market two or three years.</li>
									<li>Be highly alert to market turns.  "It is the change in the major trend that hurts most speculators."</li>
									<li>Make sure the general market will be a helper to the trend you are expecting.  Stand on the right side of the market – do not hold against market.</li>
									<li>Do not let daily changes to mislead you. Maintain the big picture right.</li>
									<li>Use different tactics to different market conditions.  </li>
									<li>Do more longs in bull market and more shorts in bear market.</li>
									</ul><br>
								</li>
								<li>CHOOSE LEADING STOCKS.<br>	
									It is a good stock for long if:
									<ul>
									<li>It is the best stock in these leading and hot industry groups.</li>
									<li>Aggressive business with great potentials.</li>
									<li>A lot of cash, not much debt.</li>
									<li>Revenue and earning are strongly going up sequentially.</li>
									<li>The stock has strong price growth.</li>
									<li>It is pretty active.</li>
									</ul><br>
									Avoid to touch (do not even spend time on it):<br>
									<ul>
									<li>Penny stocks (under $5). There is a reason to be cheap.  No bargain/cheap seekers, but be a trend follower.  Cheap stocks are often not bargains because they are not going anywhere generally.</li>
									<li>Big company in non-popular industry groups.</li>
									<li>Revenue and earning are flat.</li>
									<li>The stock’s price does not go anywhere much.</li>
									</ul><br>
								</li>


								<li>GO WITH THE TREND – MAKE PROFIT FROM START.<br>
									<ul>
									<li>Long on strong stocks in up trend market and short on weak stocks in down trend market.  </li>
									<li>Don't trade against the prevailing trend of a stock or the general market.  
									Always go LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE  (i.e. the right trend).
									<li>Stay out and wait for confirmation if market is in sideways.  In a market moving sideways in a narrow channel, 
									there is a great danger in trying to predict or anticipate WHEN and 
									in WHAT DIRECTION the market will move.  WAIT for confirmation!</li>
									<li>(Gerald M. Loeb)Following trends is easier than trying to call turns in them.  
									To put it another way, it is more likely to pay off to buy into an 
									advancing situation at a seemingly high price than to attempt to discover 
									when a declining situation will stop declining and turn upward.  </li>
									<li>Do not buy (long) the way down or short on rally.  
									After a big decline from its previous high, any stock (!) can go down further.  
									A stock that goes up can go higher. Do not worry about catching the tops or bottoms.</li>
									<li>Do not hold or add to a losing position.</li>
									<li>The trend is your friend.  Like water, do not contend the trend.</li>
									<li>Stay away from dead fishes or non-trend stocks.</li>
									</ul><br>
								</li>

								<li>BE PATIENT FOR THE RIGHT TIME.<br>
									<ul>
									<li>It’s the patience that makes the money.  Make a trade until as many factors as possible are in your favor. </li> 
									<li>Never make any trade unless you know you can do so with financial safety.
									If you could not find good stock with nice entry point, stay out and wait.</li>
									<li>Do not rush for a minute profit.  Missing a chance is better than entering a wrong position since the recovery for 
									a bad buy is usually terrible.</li>
									<li>Buy at support.  Sell at resistance.</li>
									<li>Major convergence signals the best trades.</li>
									<li>The perfect opportunity rarely exists.</li>
									<li>The big move hides just beyond price congestions.  </li>
									<li>"Enter in mild times and exit in wild times." </li>
									<li>Do not count on the agitated crowd for your trading signals.</li>
									<li>Perfect patterns carry the greatest risk for failure.</li>
									<li>Market mechanics work to defeat the majority.</li>
									<li>Double thinking time.  Before taking a position, just walk away from the desk and double think about it. </li> 
									<li>A good practice is to write down the reasons to do it or work through a list.</li>
									<li>Do not predicate price tops or bottoms, but be patient in waiting for the signals.  </li>
									<li>Act quickly when signals come.  Do not hope an exit price.</li>
									<li>Enter a position only when you are confident about the probability.</li>
									<li>Long at low cost and short at high price.  Short the bounce, but not sell-off.</li>
									<li>In the five-day chart, look for double top or bottom, or break out.  </li>
									<li>If chart looks straight up, wait for consolidation or pullback to get in.</li>
									<li>Find safe entrance points – with minimum risk to know if you are wrong.</li>
									<li>Do not buy or short JUST because you think a stock is undervalued or overvalued.</li>
									</ul><br>
								</li>
								
								<li>CONTROL THE RISK and HAVE RESERVE.<br>
									<ul>
									<li>Bet limited size at one time.</li>
									<li>Do not add to a losing position.</li>
									<li>Always issue stop-loss orders to control the loss.</li>
									<li>Always have cash in reserve (like troops) – commits the reserve armies for final victory until all the odds are in your favor.</li>
									<li>Do not be invested in the market all the time.  Let the account be flow.  If the profit is slow, or it is going away, get out. </li> 
									<li>Take 50% of profit in safe place or reserve, especially after profit doubled.</li>
									<li>Sell to the sleeping point.</li>
									<li>Use PROBE and average up method to trade safely; be sure to confirm your judgment before you take your full position.</li>
									<li>Never meet a margin call (just ask them to sell).</li>
									<li>Luck will come if you are doing the right thing.  Gamble without knowledge is dangerous.</li>
									<li>Big losses rarely come without warning.</li>
									<li>Control risk before seeking reward.</li>


									<li>Cut loss quickly and never add to losers to avoid huge damage in one holding.</li>
									<li>The market may not come back after a decline – cut to control the risk.  
									You can always re-enter later if time comes or get even better opportunities.</li>
									<li>Do not gamble, but go with courage.  Bet large size if it is a good chance.  
									If not so sure, reduce the bet size.  Use three levels on bet: half account, 
									full account, and full margin.  For long time holdings, try to diversify to reduce risk.</li>
									<li>Never move the stop loss to allow more loss to go through.</li>
									<li>Do not let the "fundamental" or "technical analysis" judgment delay or 
									cancel such a cut loss order.</li>
									<li>Never become an involuntary investor by holding a declining stock.</li>
									<li>Be highly alert to losses, like walking on thin ice.   Profits take care 
									of themselves – losses never do.</li>
									<li>When a stock is cut loss, do not get in before it has confirmed trend signals!</li>
									<li>Accept small losses as part of the game if you want to win.</li>
									<li>Know the price that violates the pattern.</li>
									<li>Be always adaptive to the market.  If wrong, get out quickly.  Do not hold or 
									add to a losing position.  Trust your judgment before signals have shown the other ways.</li>
									<li>Get out immediately if doubt or realize a wrong entrance – cut loss early and small.</li>
									<li>Sell even if profit is slow.</li>
									<li>Escape quickly if there is a danger!  Use market orders if necessary.</li>
									<li>Sometimes may sell if take profit or minimize the loss on the way up. When the 
									ship is sinking, don't pray, but jump.</li>
									<li>"Even being right three or four times out of ten should yield a person a fortune 
									if he has the sense to cut his losses quickly on the ventures where he has been wrong."</li>
									<li>Develop and maintain an exit plan.  Follow this plan with rigid discipline.</li>
									<li>Sell on any (unconfirmed) advance that follows a confirmed decline if missed any 
									earlier chances.</li>	
									<li>Sell on bad news.  Sell if there are good news and promotions but prices stay or drop.</li>
									<li>Sell if it is going up or down too much too fast.</li>
									<li>Sell to stop the profit slipping away on a down day.  When realize it has been 
									bought at a high point, be alert to get any chance to sell for a profit or small loss.</li>
									<li>Detect the bear rally.  Do not hold on any (unconfirmed) advance that follows
									 a confirmed decline.  You should have sold earlier, but if you hesitated, get out 
									 with this advantage.</li>
									<li>Sell at the first sign of a dangerous warning signal.</li>
									</ul><br>
								</li>

								<li>AVOID OVER TRADING AND LET THE PROFIT RUN.<br>
									<ul>
									<li>Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit.</li>
									<li>95% profit may come from 5% trade.  Big movements take time to develop.  
									Sit tight if necessary.  Let big winners run.</li>
									<li>Sit tight with courage to wait for the exit signals.  It takes time for a stock to 
									run out its logical and natural course.  It is not the thinking that makes the money, 
									it is the sitting and waiting that makes the money.</li>
									<li>In a good market, to reach largest profit, sell only after see the danger signals.</li>
									<li>Do not over trade and lose the sense of balance which is essential to success.</li>
									<li>Let your profits ride if there is no good reason to close out the position.</li>
									<li>Try to catch these big moves and ignore the small daily vibration.</li>
									<li>There is not a fix limit on how long one position needs to be held.  
									The key is to judge whether it is in the normal and expected range.</li>
									</ul><br>
								</li>
								
								<li>NO PREDICATION.<br>
									<ul>
									<li>Do not try to predicate the price whether it is too high or too lower.</li>
									<li>Do not buy or short JUST because you think a stock is undervalued or overvalued.   
									Wait until the market gives you the clues, the signals, the hints, before you move.  
									Anticipation is a killer.</li>
									<li>Do not predicate the trend before the trend is formed.  Follow the trend.</li>
									<li>Try to stand aside from a position, knowing you have taken a position. 
									You can’t tell if your judgment is right until you place a bet – take the risk.</li>
									</ul><br>
								</li>
								
								<li>RIGHT MIND SET.<br>
									<ul>
	 
									<li>Always have faith in yourself.</li>
									<li>If you have to look, it is not there.  Trust your instincts and act quickly.</li>
									<li>Profit and discomfort stand side by side.  The way that scares you the most is probably the way to go.</li>
									<li>Don't blame the market for your losses.  Stock market is never wrong, traders are wrong.</li>
									<li>Don't argue with the tape.  Do not seek to lure the profit back. Quit while the quitting is good--and cheap.  Do not choose loser.</li>
									<li>Stock market only deals in facts, reality, reason – no hopeful thinking. Do not dream the exit price, but rely on the chart and facts.</li>
									<li>Be courageous.  If a soldier is brave, there is no enemy.  Go for it if there is an opportunity.</li>
									<li>Be alert as if walk on thin ice.  Cool down and be more careful after big wins or losses.</li>
									<li>Keep cool, confident, and conscious, with peace of mind.  Do not trade if mind is not balanced.</li>
									<li>The speculator's chief enemies are always boredom from within.  Do not permit yourself to be influenced by excitement, flattery, or temptation.</li>
									<li>You may be daring, but, like a good general, you need to know when to retreat.</li>
									<li>You may be aggressive, but never to the point of foolhardiness.</li>
									<li>Stock is a gold mine, but full of traps.  Trading is like walking on ice – should be alert to the danger signals.</li>
									<li>A man must believe in himself and his judgment if he expects to make a living at this game.  Trust your instincts but no stubborn.</li>
									<li>Study at leisure and act quickly.  If it is a wind fall, grab it.  If it is a bad news, do not hesitate but sell.</li>
									<li>Failure to take advantage of a serendipitous act of good luck in the stock market is often a mistake.</li>
									<li>Failure to take the opportunity to get out of large illiquid positions when the opportunity presents itself can cost.</li>
									<li>Never get married to a stock.</li>
									<li>Do not concentrate on break-even levels when you are losing.</li>
									<li>Do not dream the exit price, but rely on the chart and facts.  Stock market only deals in facts, reality, reason – no hopeful thinking.</li>
									<li>Do not try to make profit in every transaction.  Cutting out from wrong side of market is a necessary step when it is needed.</li>
									<li>Whatever is hard to do in the market is generally the right thing.  Long on a breakdown and short in a rally – seems easy!</li>
									<li>Until one is committed, there is hesitancy.</li>
									<li>Thinking slowly and act swiftly.</li>
									<li>Sell when you can, not when you have to.</li>
									<li>Never too high to long or too low to short.</li>
									<li>Things over grown will always decline.  Know what is enough.</li>
									<li>Follow the rules.  The only time you really lose money is when you break your own rules.</li>
									<li>Greed or fear will dominate you if you do not have enough knowledge, experience or certain rules to guide you.</li>
									<li>Everybody is afraid.  It is what you do with that fear that separates the guy who is a coward from the guy who is courageous.   – From Mike Tyson’s experience.</li>
									<li>The only thing I think about when I make a trade, I’m never thinking about how much I’m going to make, 
									I’m always concerned about where I’m going to get out if I’m wrong.</li>
									<li>The real players really and truly do not focus on the money.</li>
									<li>Remove personal emotion from a market decision.</li>
									<li>He who hesitates is lost.</li>
									<li>Have an edge.</li>
									<li>Focus on the process instead of the results – A journey in search of excellence.</li>
									<li>Overtime, many battle scars teach a profound understanding of the modern financial markets.</li>
									<li>SUCCESS FORMULA = ( Rules * Knowledge * Patience * Experience ) / ( Ignorance * Hope * Greed * Fear ).</li>
									</ul>
